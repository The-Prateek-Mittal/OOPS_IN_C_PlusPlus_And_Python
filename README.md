# OOPS-in C++ and Python

📌 About the Repository

This repository is designed to help learners clearly understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in two different languages:

🔹 C++ Section

Each OOP concept is implemented in a separate .cpp file

Code is commented to explain:

- Classes & Objects

- Constructors & Destructors

- Encapsulation

- Abstraction

- Inheritance (single, multilevel, multiple, hierarchical)

- Polymorphism (compile-time & runtime)

- Operator Overloading

- Function Overloading

- Virtual Functions



🔹 Python Section

All OOP concepts are combined into one Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

Notebook includes explanatory text cells + executable code cells

Demonstrates OOP the Pythonic way, covering:

- Classes & Objects

- Constructors

- Inheritance

- Polymorphism

- Encapsulation

- Method Overriding



This dual-language approach helps learners compare how OOP concepts differ between C++ (strict OOP) and Python (flexible, dynamic OOP).
